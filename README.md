# Physics Informed Neural Network 
With the aid of neural networks composed of at least one hidden layer, we apply physics equations to our data to make predictions about unseen data 
# inputs and outputs
we have 3 inputs(x, y,z ) at several locations, and output at corresponding locations are (Bx, By, Bz)
